        The titans shape Azeroth after banishing the elementals & the Old Gods and construct the Well of Eternity at the world's center, then task the titan-forged keepers with its protection. After their departure, the titans are betrayed and killed by Sargeras, who creates the Burning Legion and sets on a mission to undo their work. Ages past, the keepers empower the dragon aspects to become Azeroth's new protectors. Not long after, internal conflicts ravage the keepers' unity and Loken emerges as the ruler of Ulduar, where he fabricates the Tribunal of Ages to replace the Discs of Norgannon as his own record of history. Yogg-Saron exploits the chaos to discretely infest the Forge of Wills with the curse of flesh, which slowly creeps into the titan-forged populations and gives rise to the first mortal races.
